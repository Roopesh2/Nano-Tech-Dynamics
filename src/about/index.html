			<h2>Nano Tech Dynamics</h2>
			<b>Nano Tech Dynamics</b> is an offshoot company of LNC CNC Consultants registered in the state of Kerala aiming
			to
			contribute the manufacturing of ultra-precision components sector. We have been attracted by the present Kerala
			Government's policy to invite investments/startups to begin new endeavors for industrial development and
			employment
			generation. We have observed that in the area of cutting edge technology in the private sector, the state is
			lagging
			behind and our expertise can be enhanced with more exposure. We are proposing to commence a venture in the Kinfra
			Defence Park Ottapalam and The KINFRA is allotted required land for setting up an industry in the above mentioned
			model. We look forward to support Defense sector, Nuclear Industry and ISRO as our potential clients.

			<h2>LN CNC Consultants</h2>
			We started Computerized Numeric Control (CNC) operator and programmer training for Indian Industry way back in
			1995. Back in those days small scale/private industries in Mumbai had very few CNC Machines operational. The field
			was starving for trained manpower to cater to the need of industries. As the need of industry developed we added
			CAD/CAM/CMM training into our portfolio among other designing/manufacturing processes.
			We expertise in all types of CNC controls and machines up to 11 axes. We are also the pioneers in Micro components
			suited for medical industry and biological micro reactors. Over the years we have also worked a lot in supporting
			heavy to very heavy industry catering to Ship and Submarine manufacturing as well.
			There was a huge demand in the ultra-precision component manufacturing industry for components and parts for
			Brayton / Stirling cryocoolers, Turbo expanders for helium liquefaction plants, Medical equipment accelerators
			among others. We identified this opportunity and stepped up to cater to the pressure of delivering high quality
			products for the above mentioned projects with our experience in the industry to the utmost satisfaction of our
			customers.
			We are extremely proud to announce that LN CNC Consultants were advisors for Diamond turning facility when it
			initiated for the first time in India. We also support IIT Bombay as Machining Consultant for Aero Space incubator
			set up. We have manufactured and supplied enormous Ultra precision component for Nuclear Industry as well. We also
			associated with Godrej Industries for Brahmos Project for the Defense Department.
			Among other works, we are proud to be one of the machining consultants for manufacturing Naval Ships and
			Sub-marine Mechanical Seals. We are expert in Machining of Memory Recognizing materials of Seal Rings for Tejas
			Air Craft. We have indigenously developed 4-Axis CNC Milling Machine for Micro Machining and Nano finishing. We
			are associated with surface finishing process and machine development for Metal Mirror polishing. Laser marking,
			ultra sound machining, electro chemical machining for Micro components manufacturing industry, supporting for
			ophthalmic lenses manufacturing is something we have worked extensively in.
			<ul>
				<li>Indigenously development of 4-Axis CNC Milling Machine</li>
				<li>machining of key Components of Turbo Molecular Pump</li>
				<li>Electron Beam accelerator for Medical & Industrial purpose</li>
				<li>manufacturing of antenna for strategic applications</li>
				<li>manufacturing of Brayton / Stirling cryo cooler components</li>
				<li>5-Axis machining of Turbines</li>
				<li>Addictive Manufacturing of Impellers</li>
